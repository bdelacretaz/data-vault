Open Source communities sometimes speak of Shared Neurons when great ideas come together as if sparked by a giant collective brain. Can we take inspiration from them and foster such neuron sharing in our teams? We will describe the tools and techniques used by successful Open Source projects to ""put their brains together"", by communicating openly and often, exposing concrete ideas early in prototype code, collaborating asynchronously and deliberately slowing things down to take advantage of unexpected Eureka moments.

Based on years of experiences in multiple Open Source projects, this talk will help you better understand what makes our communities so powerful and how to transpose this in your own teams.","open source,collaboration,apache,apachecon,community",presentation,en,public,372,361,11,0,1,0

Dans un monde qui se numérise toujours plus, les logiciels libres sont partout: dans votre téléphone, votre ascenseur, votre voiture, votre banque, etc… plus que jamais, l’Open Source est au coeur de notre monde numérique.

Au-delà de ces contributions très concrètes au bien-être de nos sociétés, les communautés Open Source ont aussi inventé et mis en pratique des techniques de collaboration innovantes, distribuées, asynchrones. Souvent sans chef clairement identifié, ni planification précise, ces groupes de travail informels produisent des logiciels de grande qualité, qui pour certains ont créé des marchés ou révolutionnés les pratiques numériques. Le succès de ces groupes est étonnant quand on le compare aux nombreux projets informatiques ratés dans des groupes beaucoup plus structurés, entreprises ou organismes d’Etat par exemple.

L’Open Source change le monde…vraiment? Tout en gardant les choses en perspective, nous présenterons plusieurs exemples concrets où cela se vérifie, par la création d’outils partagés, la découverte de talents, la diffusion des connaissances et la création de logiciels d’infrastructure qui sont devenus des standards de l’industrie.","open source,apache,blendwebmix,collaboration",presentation,fr,public,487,466,21,0,6,0

Moving house with the help of a group of friends is an interesting exercise in collective improvisation and coordination. Everybody can help with most of the jobs at hand, so the challenge is to keep people busy in a meaningful way, to make the best use of the physical and intellectual resources available, while keeping people happy and engaged.

Sounds familiar? The Moving House model does apply to other types of group projects, including software development. Adhocracy, Asynchronous Collaboration and a can-do attitude, as practiced in Open Source communities, are key elements that enable groups that have no formal structure to collaborate efficiently and smoothly - like when helping friends moving house.","collaboration,opensource,opendevelopment,fossbackstage",presentation,en,public,258,241,17,0,0,0
