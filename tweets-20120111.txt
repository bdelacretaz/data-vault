       29688260997  Nov  4  2010  @bdelacretaz  @elecharny I’d say Stanbol is turkish-ish - the decision to incubate was made in Istanbul, it’s a somewhat unique name that sounds like it.

        1564180089  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @bhillou Instead of creating a new spec, people might spend them money creating WebDAV libraries for PHP and Javascript ;-)
        1564126234  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @sfermigier agree that atom of contents needs to be defined...not on Twitter though, need more bandwidth ;-)
        1564089772  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @scroisier I have no idea why IETF WebDAV is not more involved in CMIS, don't know much about both groups...just my tech guts speaking here
        1564067694  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @scroisier The Power Of Marketing comes to mind...and getting rid of the http only approach seems like a bad idea to me anyway. #cmis
        1564012418  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @sfermigier You could probably consider a CMIS document as an atom of content, but that seems to me like bending the idea...
        1563963607  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  @sfermigier there's no fine-grained content support in CMIS as far as I know - it's meant for documents as opposed to atoms of content
        1563936321  Apr 20  2009  @bdelacretaz  Agree with @scroisier : FMIS or CMIS? http://post.ly/Ku1 - but then why reinvent WebDAV??

        1067115608  Dec 19  2008  @bdelacretaz  Joost blog: "It was always our intention to discontinue the Joost software application" - those who sweated to create it will like that ;-)
        1066664020  Dec 19  2008  @bdelacretaz  Walk (er..cycle) the dog. Cycle to work. Work. Lab7 christmas party tonight.

        1065007231  Dec 18  2008  @bdelacretaz  Loading the background teletype sounds in case someone pastes stuff in IRC in the meeting later today
        1064823298  Dec 18  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jukkaz fetchmail  --folder should allow you to grab selected message from Gmail. I used IMAP and a mail client to do that.
        1064802527  Dec 18  2008  @bdelacretaz  http://www.jingproject.com/ (via @chregu) is way cool - instant screencasts!
        1064492569  Dec 18  2008  @bdelacretaz  More snow - waiting for a bit more daylight before cycling to the office
        1063099049  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  Test-driven development is so cool when you put all pieces together and it just works. Well, almost ;-)
        1063038073  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  @rbowen wins against insurance companry, do your hear that? great news!
        1063036607  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  @chregu not sure about lots of hidden bugs, but one needs to get used to the CRX explorer's way of doing things
        1063007373  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  Just got a Google alert for an entry that I posted on my blog two and half hours ago, that's fast
        1062949481  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  Green diamond tires are great for the roads we have these days, my humble doblo feels like a ratrac - http://www.greendiamondtire.com/
        1062351543  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  ASF voting done. mbox -> grep bin/vote -> edit -> cat votes | ssh me@you.know.where
        1062341697  Dec 17  2008  @bdelacretaz  More snow. We haven't had that much since a few years.
        1060872398  Dec 16  2008  @bdelacretaz  #asfmembers meeting means I'm missing the drinks @eclau (you guys are used to me saying "next time hopefully" by now ;-)
        1058865077  Dec 15  2008  @bdelacretaz  Looks like cff.ch forgot about all timetables for my village's bus stops after this weekend's schedule changes. Cycling is better ;-)
        1058741851  Dec 15  2008  @bdelacretaz  58% of voters say chipmunks should get loans for their nuclear submarines. That's reassuring. Or not.
        1058653800  Dec 15  2008  @bdelacretaz  @rbowen I do hate all wordprocessors equally but Word is more equal than others. Structured writing wins every time.
        1058151799  Dec 15  2008  @bdelacretaz  Downloading from SourceForge feels like watching cheap TV with more commercials than content.
        1055100386  Dec 13  2008  @bdelacretaz  Playing at the prison with the band today - exciting and scary at the same time.
        1053462663  Dec 12  2008  @bdelacretaz  Swiss lakes are full of chipmunks in nuclear subs already - cannot trust all swiss bankers I guess.
        1053188010  Dec 12  2008  @bdelacretaz  I thought my Sling blog example would work in 36 lines of code but it's 46. #codebloat

        1051398506  Dec 11  2008  @bdelacretaz  Lunch with @ebruchez made me wish to try the Orbeon stuff in Sling but someone beat me to it: ttp://tinyurl.com/5gjjrp

        1050117964  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jimjag I do remember mercurochrome, and I still use "eosine" (french name?) which is similar and very efficient (and visible ;-)

        1048834720  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  sh*t - swiss federal council election result could have been more fun, it's over now - official candidate Ueli Maurer elected
        1048822472  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  swiss federal council election: the candidate who's now in front has to leave his party if elected, as per that party's new rules ;-)
        1048807921  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  Keeping an eye on swiss federal council election - video from parlement.ch and audio commentary from rsr.ch, live mashup!
        1048793745  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  @trieloff agree that http://titaniumapp.com is a great idea - use the same language everywhere. It's just missing an embedded JCR ;-)
        1048732057  Dec 10  2008  @bdelacretaz  Not cycling today, staying home - but shoveling snow is good exercise too.

        1044778617  Dec  8  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jmettraux I know...cercle des agriculteurs is the best place around, but this particular meeting has to be in Montreux ;-)

        1037837142  Dec  4  2008  @bdelacretaz  At the office continuing my quest for OSGi happiness, beating the box with tons of bundles (SLING-747)
        1036107751  Dec  3  2008  @bdelacretaz  Now I can torture this OSGi thingy with thousands of cloned bundles at the flick of a switch. <insert sarcastic laugh>
        1034620361  Dec  2  2008  @bdelacretaz  Done for today, the torture test with 1000 generated OSGi bundles will be for tomorrow
        1034189682  Dec  2  2008  @bdelacretaz  Indeed, great conversation with @ebruchez and @ceki - need to have a closer look at how Orbeon XForms stuff could work with Sling
        1033962642  Dec  2  2008  @bdelacretaz  Lunch with @ebruchez and @ceki
        1033884285  Dec  2  2008  @bdelacretaz  @ebruchez Lausanne is not that warm, but warmer than last week!
        1033824827  Dec  2  2008  @bdelacretaz  5 more degrees than last week, +2 celsius now. Feels like spring for cycling...
        1029125476  Nov 29  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jukkaz 57wpm and 3 mistakes. But not drunk ;-)
        1028659326  Nov 29  2008  @bdelacretaz  www.secretbasel.ch and www.lesgarecons.ch were very nice. And there are some gray areas in the basilisk spec - will blog about that later.
        1027935526  Nov 28  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jimjag sorry to hear that, get well soon!
        1027935027  Nov 28  2008  @bdelacretaz  Off to a www.secretbasel.ch tour later today, wonder what that will be
        1026585505  Nov 27  2008  @bdelacretaz  @ebruchez agree, "low-hanging fruit" is often positive while "solution de facilite" tends to be negative...no better translation here...
        1026069286  Nov 27  2008  @bdelacretaz  @dashorst lucky you, your slideshare upload worked. @slideshare, my one-week old upload is still not converted, username bdelacretaz

        1024615962  Nov 26  2008  @bdelacretaz  @noirins correct ;-)
        1024188214  Nov 26  2008  @bdelacretaz  Snow and sun, nice morning and with the right gear cycling at -3 celsius is fine - tends to wake you up
        1022961377  Nov 25  2008  @bdelacretaz  @jmettraux indeed that ApacheCon press release is *very* strange, blogged about it at http://tinyurl.com/bertrand-apachecon-pr

        1020539555  Nov 24  2008  @bdelacretaz  Got to the office before it started snowing again - the new bike is much better than the old one meteorologically speaking ;-)
        1020535859  Nov 24  2008  @bdelacretaz  @ordnas my own is a flyer c8+, http://tinyurl.com/5kol9c and I'm testing a t8hs, http://tinyurl.com/5uwxj5 - much faster and nicer
        1020484132  Nov 24  2008  @bdelacretaz  Winter is definitely here, snow for three days in a row now - a good test for new flyer ebike
        1018637200  Nov 22  2008  @bdelacretaz  Electric bicycle battery dying, why not get a new bike? Testing a used flyer t8hs that I might get for a good price, looks good
        1016836957  Nov 21  2008  @bdelacretaz  JCR presentation went very well - that's easy when people are suffering with aging content silos
        1016305748  Nov 21  2008  @bdelacretaz  Nearly missed the train...cycling with strong headwinds and rain is not the best way to arrive early
        1016237080  Nov 21  2008  @bdelacretaz  Ready for my presentation of this afternoon, 4 minutes before I have to go. Good timing ;-)

        1004566261  Nov 14  2008  @bdelacretaz  Why does OSGi insist on *everything* being asynchronous? Being able to switch to synchronous at times would make things much easier.
        1004418717  Nov 13  2008  @bdelacretaz  Articles like http://tinyurl.com/67lzeh (about the new Day CQ% release) make the long work days of these last weeks more bearable
